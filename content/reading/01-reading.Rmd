## Required

Remember, this reading is mostly supplemental and will help you if there are concepts that are unclear in class.

- [R and RStudio Basics](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/3-rstudiobasics.html) - make sure to watch the videos.
- [Vectors and Data Frames](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/wrangling.html#vectors-and-data-frames)
- [Rstudio projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)


## Optional 

### Markdown Basics

This is a short reference on how to do formatting in Markdown. This is optional, but may be a helpful reference as you continue on and work with Markdown and RMarkdown.

### Swirl Basics

I'm going to highlight another resource for learning basic R concepts: `swirl`. This is a software package for R.

To start it, run the following code in the console in RStudio Cloud:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(swirl)
swirl()
```

You'll want to take a look at the `R Programming` course, especially the following sections:

1. Basic Building Blocks
3. Sequences of Numbers
4. Vectors
5. Missing values
