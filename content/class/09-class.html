<h2>Muddiest Points</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I am confused on where and how nested data frames are used.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m still a little unclear on how to write functions to use with map on df after group_nest. The explanation was clear, I think I just need to try it myself to get the hang of it! I start to lose track of which column/variable goes where and contains what.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I need a lot more time to process “map” because it feels like a very big and powerful tool…but maybe too big to wrap my head around?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, <code>map()</code> and <code>nest()</code> really need more than a couple classes to work through, I think. I believe it’s very important to learn tools like this because it using functions and iteration is truly when you start “programming with R (and that’s the name of the class!). But I think this will take some practice. I wish we had more time to practice!</p>
<p>Definitely take advantage of all the resources out there to learn more if you are interested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function section of the lecture and the use of Purrr</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a hard time following along with the functions during class</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m happy to go over any of the functions again if you would like. Just let me know which are the most confusing and I can go over them again more slowly in the last class!</p>

<h1>Clearest points</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The first half of this class felt great because it was adding onto knowledge I already had re: biostats. So it was easy to understand how to apply that knowledge in R.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stats! Clear explanation of regression code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great, I hope the next couple classes are useful to learn more about statistical modeling in R. It’s a wide world out there, so we can only briefly touch on various examples, but I hope it’s enough to get you started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like the group_split() function!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The class-specific versions of map</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>creating functions and lists</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ggplot section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Super!</p>

<h1>Other messages</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I had never heard of geom_errorbar() but I like it! I have tried to add error bars manually and it was a headache…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I really appreciate the walk-throughs of how to build a function (start with a specific input, then generalize), how to use map, etc. I also loved that you included the gtsummary and scales::pvalue summary, and the geom_errorbar forest plot! It’s all super useful stuff that I’ve been wishing I knew how to do but didn’t really know how to look up!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is good to hear, because I can’t really show you in detail how to build a million and one statistical models, but I can show you the tools that I use the most often. Hopefully it’s enough to make statistical analysis a bit easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like the cute pun of ‘nested’ penguins.</p>
