## R Project files

Last class we finished up part5 materials. This is class 7, and we will start with part6 now (sorry, we're going to be off by one from now on). Please download the part6 sub-folder from [this dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q4z72523kl84ywp/AAASb1YIFRpxzrjOeq1FVcXua?dl=0). Be sure to unzip if necessary. Knit the `part6.Rmd` to install any required packages.

This section is mainly a practice, with some additional ggplot lessons. There will be lots of time for breakout room challenges so that you can get practice working on these data wrangling and graphing problems together.
