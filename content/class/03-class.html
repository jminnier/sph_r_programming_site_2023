<h2>R Project files</h2>
<p>Please download the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6071l3w2c7janda/AACbC_iGdedvuOfBA9Jy25Soa?dl=0">part3</a> folder for class materials. Use the grey “download” button to download the whole folder, please keep the file structure and folder organization exactly the same as we need this for class. Be sure to unzip if necessary.

<div id="readings" class="section level2">
<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>Required and suggested class readings can be found on the Readings tab by class. These readings may be done anytime before or after class, but they will supplement your understanding of the class materials and help make homework and project work easier.</p>

<div id="class-video" class="section level2">
<h2>Class Video</h2>
<p>The class video is here, but I forgot to video tape the part about <code>here::here()</code>. If I have a chance I will re-record myself talking about it, but in the meantime, <a href="https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=1463">click here for Ted’s video from last year</a>, which explains similar ideas.</p>
