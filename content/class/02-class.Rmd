## R Project files

Please download the `part2` folder from [this dropbox folder link](https://bit.ly/bsta504_dropbox_2023) Be sure to unzip if necessary. In advance of class, please open the `part2` Rstudio project (double click on the `.rproj` file), open `part2.Rmd` and `knit` (click the Knit button at the top of the file) this file. This will install packages that you need for the Rmd to run.

## Readings

Required and suggested class readings can be found on the Readings tab by class. These readings may be done anytime before or after class, but they will supplement your understanding of the class materials and help make homework and project work easier.

## Class Video

Class video recording will be posted on Slack.
